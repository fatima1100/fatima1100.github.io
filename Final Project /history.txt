<h2>HISTORY ON GRAFFITI</h2>
<p>When it first started....</p>

<p> 
The first drawings on walls appeared in caves thousands of years ago. Later the Ancient Romans and Greeks wrote their names and protest poems on buildings. Modern graffiti seems to have appeared in Philadelphia in the early 1960s
</p>

<p>
The new art form really took off in the 1970s, when people began writing their names, or tags, on buildings all over the city.
