<h2>Graffiti VS. Vandalism</h2>
<p>Graffiti has been around for a long time, since there were markings in caves. It started to be recognized during the holocaust and started to become a huge part of our culture during the 1960s. People used it as a form of expression,to claim there territory. But over the years it became Art, but even now there can be controversy in whether graffiti is consdiered Art or Vandalism.</p>
<p>Peter Vallone, a New York city councillor, thinks that graffiti done with permission can be art, but if it is on someone elseâ€™s property it becomes a crime. </p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>Do you think Graffiti is Art or Vandalism? </p>

    <h1>What Is The Differnce?</h1>
    <p>Vandalism is willful damage or destruction of any property with no other purpose than damage or destruction of said property while graffiti is a form of vandalism involving painting text or images in public places.</p>
    <p>Personally, i think that Graffiti or street Art should be conisdered Art. Art isnt based off of where you make it, its comes with the inteion for everyone to see. </p>

  <p>To conclude Art is a form of expression that Shouldn't be determined about where, or when its made. Its based off of the story and the feelin it gives the viwer.</p>
